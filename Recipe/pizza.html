    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Pepperoni pizza is a popular and classic type of pizza known for its bold flavors and crispy texture. It features a traditional pizza base made from a yeast-leavened dough, which is rolled out and topped with a rich tomato sauce. Over the sauce, a generous layer of mozzarella cheese is added, creating a gooey and melty foundation for the main topping: pepperoni.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The combination of the tangy tomato sauce, creamy melted cheese, and the spicy, savory pepperoni makes pepperoni pizza a favorite among many pizza lovers. It's often enjoyed with a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes or a drizzle of olive oil, and pairs well with a variety of beverages</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F or 45째C)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2-3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced pepperoni (about 30-40 slices)</li>
        <li>Optional: crushed red pepper flakes, dried oregano, or fresh basil for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><b>Prepare the Dough:</b></p>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast and 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 1/2 cups warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Add 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and 2 teaspoons salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Add more flour if needed.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <p><b>Prepare the Tomato Sauce:</b></p>
        <li>In a bowl, mix 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce with 2 teaspoons dried oregano, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</li>
        <p><b>Preheat the Oven:</b></p>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
        <p><b>Assemble the Pizza:</b></p>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions if you are making two pizzas.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a circle or rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the prepared tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sliced pepperoni evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <p><b>Bake</b></p>
        <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place it directly in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <p><b>Serve</b></p>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve hot, garnished with optional crushed red pepper flakes, dried oregano, or fresh basil if desired.</li>
    </ol>
